# My Shell Environment

This repository contains the foundation of the environment that represents my terminal. I've worked
to make this something I can immediately install onto a machine for the sake of making my life a bit
easier. With the [`jalcine-env`][1] script, one can do the following:

  * Install (and build) binaries desired
  * Setup autoenv.
  * Set up other homeshick repositories.
  * Do post-install setups for this machine.
