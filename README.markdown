# My Shell Environment

![Primary screenshot](./snapshot.png)

This repository holds the source code representing the core of my preferred
shell environment. This repository is [homeshick][] enabled - it's the
recommended means of installing and using it.

## Quick Start

You can go the _easy_ way: by using [`homeshick`][]:

```bash
$ homeshick clone git://github.com/jalcine/dotfiles.git
```

That'll clobber your current environment with my setup - be sure to backup.
