# My Dotfiles

![Snapshot in Yakuake](https://github.com/jalcine/dotfiles/raw/master/snapshot.png)

## Story

Here lies my local shell files that typically lie under my `$HOME` directory.
I really only work on Linux machines, specifically Ubuntu and Debian machines
so your mileage *will* vary. This is designed to be installed using 
[homeshick][]. This repository incorporates the following:

 + **configuration options** for `awesome_print`, `astyle`, `gem`, `git`,
   `guard`, `gdb`, `libreadline`, `irb`, `pry`, `ruby-debug`, `tmux`,
   `weechat`, `rainbarf` and a few others. There's a fairly extensive 
   collection of patched fonts I use as well as some freely available fonts.

 + **plug-ins**: a forked [`rbenv`][rbenv] with `rbenv-communal-gems`,
   `rbenv-ctags`, `rbenv-default-gems`, `rbenv-each`, `rbenv-gem-rehash`,
   `rbenv-vars`, `rbenv-whatis` and `ruby-build`; `git-hooks`;
   [`bash-it`][bashit]

 + **pre-loaded scripts**: `hub`, `composer`, [`vcprompt`][vcprompt],
    `phpctags`, and [`ls++`][lsplusplus]

## To Work On

 ✱ Add information about font sources and credit to their respective authors.

 ✱ Add proper licensing information about the files I've written.

 ✱ Add more dependency checking for binaries, tool chains and the likes.

 ✱ Allow this repository to install the jazz for vim and tmux.
