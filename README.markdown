# My Shell Options

> Last Stable Release: **2017-06-15 11:18:50 PDT**

This [homes(h)ick][1]-powered repository holds the base configuration I use to
handle my machine's setup. I use [a Bash script to set up the initial
environment][2].

I donâ€™t rely on the system to provide me with language interpreters for
everything. I use [`anyenv`][] to manage these things. It has support for quite
a few languages including Go, Elixir and Python.
