# My Shell Options

This [homes(h)ick][1]-powered repository holds the base configuration I use to
handle my machine's setup. I use [a Bash script to set up the initial
environment][2].

I donâ€™t rely on the system to provide me with language interpreters.
I use [`anyenv`][3] to manage these things. It has support for quite a few
languages including Go, Elixir and Python.
