# dotfiles, yo!

Being a developer that works across multiple systems like Linux machines or Macbooks,
having a place to run back to and call home is always useful. This is why I use 
[Josh Nichols's awesome tool](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) for copying and sharing 
your local configuration scripts and what not. It makes it easy to share the changes I have
for my laptop, my servers (and other machines I plan to grab). It also makes work so much
easier when working on out-sourced machines as well.
