# Miscelleanous User Configuration Files

![Screenshots or it didn't happen.](https://github.com/jalcine/dotfiles/blob/master/screenshot.gif?raw=true)

This repository is a [homeshick][1]-powered module that holds my miscelleanous
configuration files for an operating system. It holds options for:

+ **Ruby tools** like `irb`, `awesome_print`, `gem`.
+ [**`rbenv`**][2] with packaged plug-ins.
+ [**`phpenv`**][6] and [**`php-build`**][7]
+ **`gdb`** plug-ins for Qt pretty-printing.
+ **`tmux`** status line options and configuration tweaks.
+ specific font options (anti-aliasing and hinting)
+ options for `libreadline`, `ctags`, `console-setup` and `astyle`.

[**`bash-it`**][3] adds in some more magic like:

+ quick configuration options for 
 + Android development
 + CPAN usage
 + aliasing quick HTTP server (a l√° `SimpleHTTPServer`)
 + quick file-type extraction (zip, gz, tar) via `extract`
 + nifty use of `fasd` for quick directory jumping
 + [using `ctags` and CSS][8]
 + [`vcprompt` shipped][5].

I use quite of a bit of Private Use characters as well as dingbats (though I'm
trying to be 100% dingbats for more font support).

## Quick Install
In order to properly install these files, you'd need [homeshick][1] sitting on
your computer. You can do that by invoking the [de-facto installation steps][4].
You'd then add my dotfiles as a castle by doing the following:

```
$ homeshick clone git://github.com/jalcine/dotfiles
$ homeshick link dotfiles
```

And **wham**! You got my system up and running.
