# dotfiles, yo!

Being a developer that works across multiple systems like Linux machines or Macbooks,
having a place to run back to and call home is always useful. This is why I use 
[Josh Nichols's awesome tool](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) for copying and sharing 
your local configuration scripts and what not. It makes it easy to share the changes I have
for my laptop, my servers (and other machines I plan to grab). It also makes work so much
easier when working on out-sourced machines as well.

## Contents

This repositories uses sub-modules and depends on the following repositories:

 * [jalcine/bash-it](https://github.com/jalcine/bash-it) - My fork and changes to the kickass
   [bash-it project](https://github.com/revans/bash-it).

 * [creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) - A Node version management tool.

 * [erikw/tmux-powerline](https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline) - Powerline. For TMUX. BADASS.

 * [jalcine/rbenv](https://github.com/jalcine/rbenv) - Patches to sstephenson's awesome ruby version management tool,
   [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv).

## Ambitions

What I do want to evolve from this set-up is something along this sort:

 + __Hostname loading__: I'd like for certain scripts to be run on certain machines. Anything pertaining to GUIs (like my laptop's KDE tweaks or perhaps some edits for a Macbook) should only be run on those machines. This is something I'm working on with `scutil` and `/etc/hostname`.
