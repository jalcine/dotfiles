# dotfiles, yo!

Being a developer that works across multiple systems like Linux machines or
Mac books, having a place to run back to and call ~ is always useful. In order
to maximize efficiency, my local configuration files have been split up (I have
one for [Vim](https://github.com/jalcine/vimrc), too) and made easy to install
with [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick).

## Contents
This repositories uses sub-modules and depends on the following repositories:

 * [jalcine/bash-it](https://github.com/jalcine/bash-it) - My fork and changes
  to the kickass [bash-it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it) project.

 * [jalcine/rbenv](https://github.com/jalcine/rbenv) - Patches to
  [sstephenson](https://github.com/sstephenson]'s awesome ruby version
